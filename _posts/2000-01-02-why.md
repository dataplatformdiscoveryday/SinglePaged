## Why
We're a bunch of Data Platform aficionados who love sharing our knowledge and experience. With the world in lock down a lot of the normal meetups and conferences are no going ahead. So we thought we'd do something free you can attend from where you are.

On April 29th we will be running 10 hours of content across US time zones.
Sessions will begin at 9am Eastern Time, with a new session starting each hour

On April 30th we will be running 10 hours of content European time zones.
Sessions will begin at 9am BST (UTC+1) with a new session starting each hour

Each day we'll be having 10 50 minute sessions, each of which will introduce you to a new technology in the Microsoft Data Platform

Sound good? Let's go!
