#### Basically

We're a bunch of Data Platform aficionados who love sharing our knowledge and experience. With the world in lock down a lot of the normal meetups and conferences are no going ahead. So we thought we'd do something free you can attend from where you are

1. Make a [**user homepage**](#setup-as-user-homepage) (or organization)
2. Make a [**standalone project**](#setup-as-standalone-project-page) page
3. Make a [site under an **existing project**](#setup-inside-existing-project)
