<h2 id="speakers">Speakers</h2>

<p>We are looking for great content for the event. We are running our Call for Papers via Sessionize, with one call for the whole day. </p>

<p>Weâ€™re looking for anything Data Platform-related, with special emphasis on 100-level, introductory sessions for people new to the community who may know very little about the topic.</p>

<p>Sessions will be 45 minutes long and will be recorded for later distribution via YouTube</p>
