Due to personal issues we had to take the hard decision and postpone this event until Wednesday 19th January 2022. Everything else stays the same!

Focused on helping you take your first steps into the Microsoft Data Platform world and the next steps in your career journey...

Whether you're an old hand wanting to learn something to expand your career, or someone who's just heard about it and wants to learn more, everyone is welcome!

This time we're also going be having expert panels between sessions discussing topics, and taking questions from the audience
