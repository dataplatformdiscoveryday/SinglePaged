## Speakers

We are looking for great content for the event. We are running our Call for Papers via Sessionize, with one call for the US day and another for the European day. There's nothing saying you can't submit for both!

We're looking for anything Data Platform-related, with special emphasis on 100-level, introductory sessions for people new to the community who may know very little about the topic.
