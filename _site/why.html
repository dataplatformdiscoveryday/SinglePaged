<h2>Why</h2>
<p>We’re a bunch of Data Platform aficionados who love sharing our knowledge and experience. A lot of people are feeling unsure in their current job and may be looking at a new path. We wanted to do something to welcome you into the Microsoft data platform community, gain some knowledge, and expand your network.</p>

<p>On September 21st we’ll be running 6 sessions and 6 panels from 10:00 till 19:00 UTC to cover US, European and African timezones</p>

<p>The Sessions will again be 45 minutes long aimed at people just starting their journey with the Microsoft Data and Azure platforms</p>

<p>The panels are going to be offering more general career advice, and also discussing how we can all make the Data Platform community experience better for a wider range of people</p>

<p>Sound good? Sound interesting? Let’s go!</p>
