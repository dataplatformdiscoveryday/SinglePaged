<h2>Why</h2>
<p>We’re a bunch of Data Platform aficionados who love sharing our knowledge and experience. With the world in lock down a lot of the normal meetups and conferences are no going ahead. So we thought we’d do something free you can attend from where you are.</p>

<p>On April 29th we will be running 10 hours of content across US time zones.
On April 30th we will be running 10 hours of content European time zones.</p>

<p>Each day we’ll be having 10 50 minute sessions, each of which will introduce you to a new technology in the Microsoft Data Platform</p>

<p>Sound good? Let’s go!</p>
